- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in ... How humans assign value, "confirm" reality through "observations" with the > the number of Observers cementing "reality".
- How the past defines the present, and how that projects into the future from the changeable "now". Chaos theory, in particular how starting conditions yield a vastly - different result over time. Information Exchange, (follow the leak, rumor, find the mole, etc)

I floated through high school without applying myself. That carried into my undergrad where I had to change from my topic of interest (math) to just getting the closest degree to graduation (finance). I had plenty on my mind during all that time and am honestly surprised I learned anything at all. Maybe I had bad teachers, maybe I didn't try, maybe i've finally woken up from my trauma to finally have initiative and ambition.

I've thought of a problem that hasn't really been broached in any of my research. But depending on how the generalized formula is applied, can yield insight to ML and AI decisions during the unsupervised learning phase. (for starters)

The furtherst I've gotten so far is explaining this problem in 2D is as follows:

1. For a non-zero matrix such that either the columns or rows are [M,N], are offset by 1. 
2. Create a square matrix and a vector with the same values in where the vector is in superposition with the non-square starting matrix.
3. As your basis matters here, you should have a square matrix and 4 vectors of [1,N], or [M,1]
4. Square matrix is your friend, and all known/identifiable/defined. vectors are Variable and as time progresses, "updated".
6. Each starting vector is "known", and each "update" becomes known through the time variable.
7. Differential equation is then created between each "update" to show vector fields.
8. Vectors will converge or diverge or oscillate between phases. (does the system become more entropic over time or is order brought?)
9. Observer can have data be passed through and filtered on these vector fields as time increases.
10. Divergence bounds can be set, as well as convergence limits for processing. (do we care about this data, or not)

For 3D, we attempt to make cubes, and now there's more vectors. Same process should apply, however now there's "Planes and curves" of prediction that can follow.

For 4D, hyper cubes, "volumes and shapes" of prediction

For 5D, Known evolution paths over time

For Nth D, should be able to let AI/ML handle for potential "future" prediction.



Observers act of observing data flow interupts the flow of data in the system due to superposition (requiring the need for statistics)
From here, there should be an observing process to track the evolution of the system, and the data flowing through it. (requiring calculus)
Patterns can be detected if there are "followers" along the same "path". (requiring Combinatorics)
Oberservers can act pre-emptively to enforce or deter on "follower" data. (requiring differential equations)
Data stream can be "locked in" through convergence and partition a "follower". 



The ways such a process and equation would be useful is in weather forecasts, information dissemination, network security, genetic mutations, national security, privacy, quantum research, Neurology, and other applications I haven't thought of off the top of my head.


--------------------------------------

Of course I could just be thinking incorrectly about all of this as I study more math. 
I only know what I know, and I dont know much.
Also maybe I'm treating matrices incorrectly, as they're just systems of equations.
